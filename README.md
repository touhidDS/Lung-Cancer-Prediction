# Lung Cancer Prediction  

## Overview  
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting lung cancer risk based on patient medical data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to enhance prediction accuracy.  

## Potential Applications  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
- **Data Preprocessing** (Encoding, Scaling, Handling Missing Data)  
- **Machine Learning for Lung Cancer Prediction**  
- **Statistical Analysis on Risk Factors**  
- **Deep Learning Models for Advanced Classification**  
- **Healthcare Analytics & Risk Assessment Tool Development**  

## Dataset Description  
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |  
|-------------|-----------|-------------|  
| Patient_ID | int | Unique identifier for each patient |  
| Age | int | Age of the patient |  
| Gender | object | Patientâ€™s gender (Male/Female) |  
| Smoking | object | Whether the patient smokes (Yes/No) |  
| Air_Pollution | float | Level of exposure to air pollution |  
| Genetic_Risk | object | Family history/genetic predisposition (Yes/No) |  
| Chronic_Lung_Disease | object | Presence of chronic lung diseases (Yes/No) |  
| Coughing_Blood | object | Symptom of blood in cough (Yes/No) |  
| Shortness_of_Breath | object | Difficulty in breathing (Yes/No) |  
| Lung_Cancer | object | Final diagnosis (Benign/Malignant) |  

## How to Use This Project  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize age distribution and key health indicators.  
- Analyze correlations between risk factors and lung cancer diagnosis.  
- Identify trends in lifestyle and environmental influences on cancer risk.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Smoking, Genetic_Risk).  
- Scale numerical features (e.g., Air Pollution Level).  
- Handle missing values and balance the dataset for better model performance.  

### 3. Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Implement deep learning models (ANN, CNN) for more accurate cancer prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  

### 4. Statistical Testing & Healthcare Analytics  
- Conduct hypothesis tests to analyze key risk factors.  
- Develop interactive dashboards for healthcare professionals.  

## Installation & Dependencies  
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Example Usage  
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("lung_cancer_data.csv")

# Check data structure
df.info()

# Visualize smoking distribution
sns.countplot(x=df['Smoking'])
plt.title("Smoking Status Distribution")
plt.show()
```
